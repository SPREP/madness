# Exercise 6 - Using docker-compose

As you may have noticed, our **docker run** commands are getting longer and longer with each configuration that we add. This is where the docker-compose tool comes in handy. We can use it to create a set of instructions for docker to run and use the docker-compose command to run all of them at once.

1. Create a new directory for this exercise called dc and cd into it

```bash
mkdir dc
cd dc
```

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file to hold our set of instructions

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```
